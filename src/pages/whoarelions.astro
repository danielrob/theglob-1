				<h2 class="text-[20pt] font-bold leading-8 mb-4">Mission statement and goals</h2>
				<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[1.5] mb-4">The ultimate goal of the service is to normalize regular health checks. It has long been recognized that regular health checks detect undiagnosed medical and mental conditions and provide a timely intervention for further investigations and treatment.</p>
				<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[1.5] mb-4">It is the fence at the top of the cliff rather than the ambulance at the bottom.</p>
				<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[1.5] mb-4">People in rural communities are often socially and geographically isolated. They have difficulty in obtaining timely medical services which is made worse by their day-to-day work demands.</p>
				<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[1.5] mb-4">Originally this service was targeted at farmers and their families. Most of those seen were men. Now it has morphed into a rural and urban service and the gender balance is 50:50.</p>
				<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[1.5]">There is a huge demographic variation. At our first Field days at Manfeild, 138 people were seen. There were 29 different occupations and 13 different ethnicities. Ages varied from 8 to 92 years.</p>
