	<h1>The Glob</h1>

	<div class="content-section">
		<p>The Glob is a screening service set up by Agri HQ - a media company based in Feilding. Agri HQ deals mainly with the rural communities and in this capacity attends a lot of rural events. Two years ago, they decided to set up a "My Health Check" service. They purchased a caravan and converted it into a mobile medical facility with a separate consulting room.</p>

		<h2>About the Project</h2>
		<p>The Glob represents a partnership between Agri HQ and Lions District 202D Zone 1 to bring health screening directly to rural communities. By attending farming events and gatherings, we meet farmers where they are - in their natural working environment.</p>
