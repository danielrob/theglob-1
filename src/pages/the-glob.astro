This covers an area from New Plymouth to Foxton with 34 clubs and 1000 members. It was originally set up by Agri-HQ, a media company based in Feilding. Agri HQ deals mainly with the rural communities and in this capacity attends a lot of rural events.</p>
				<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[1.5] text-left max-md:text-[12pt] mb-4">In 2020 they decided to set up a "My Health Check" service. They purchased a caravan and converted it into a mobile medical screening facility with a separate consulting room. The caravan was painted bright orange and is affectionally known as 'The Glob'.</p>
				<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[1.5] text-left max-md:text-[12pt] mb-4">In June 2021 Agri HQ 'gifted' Zone One District 202D the Glob. They recognized that NZ Lions is respected in the community and has a club in most NZ towns. Approx 25% of their members are farmers.</p>
