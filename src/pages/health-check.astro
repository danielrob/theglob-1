				<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[1.5] text-justify">There are three parts to the screening process. The farmers fill out a questionnaire. A nurse then does the clinical assessment. The GP then reviews the data collected and has a one-to-one talk with the farmer. He or she then recommends the participant see their own GP if necessary. Approx 25% need this referral.</p>

				<p>The ultimate goal of the service is to normalise regular health checks for farmers.</p>
				<p>It has long been understood that regular health checks are a prudent way to reduce our chances of getting sick, detecting potentially life-threatening health conditions and diseases early, and therefore improving our chances for treatment and cure.</p>
				<p>However, we know that many farmers often put other priorities ahead of regular health checks. We also know that many farmers have limited access to health services and many face social isolation.</p>
				<p>The service is a practical, grassroots-driven service that engages farmers in their natural working environment where they feel most comfortable and can "have their gumboots on."</p>
				<p>Comprehensive health checks are provided by nurses, St John personnel and a rural GP, working from a purpose-built caravan. The health check includes measures such as: blood pressure; pulse; weight; lung capacity; smoking status; blood sugar; cholesterol level, BMI and significant family history. Each person is also given information on current alcohol intake recommendations, a mental health "how are you" screening questionnaire as well as the 1737 Need to Talk free phone information.</p>
				<p>There is also an opportunity to discuss other health related concerns with the GP as part of the check and to date these have included difficulty registering or accessing rural general practice, stress, alcohol consumption, prostate symptoms, and cervical and breast screening.</p>
				<p>Individuals are given a written record of their visit and where areas of concern or abnormal results have been identified, they are encouraged and supported to make an appointment to see their own GP. Where permission is given, we follow up to see whether the individual did visit their GP and what the outcome of the visit was.</p>
				<p>This follow up loop is a unique aspect of the service and will connect farmers back up with their rural general practitioners enabling ongoing conversations and access to a wide range of health resources.</p>
				<p>We hope you find your health check a positive experience and one which encourages you to put yourself at the top of your to do list at least once every year and get a health check.</p>

					<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[1.5]">This is <strong>not</strong> a GP service. It is a screening service. The participant is given a copy of the questionnaire and clinical findings and takes the responsibility of seeing their own GP. A phone call is made by the GP two weeks later to check that this has been done. Local GPs are advised when the Glob will be operating in their area. They have been very supportive. The College of Rural GPs sends medical students to attend. They have loved the experience, and this bodes well for the future of rural GPs.</p>
