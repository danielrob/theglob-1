			<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[28px]">When did you last service your ute, tractor, motorbike, or more importantly...self?!!!</p>
			<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[28px]">In 2022 our company donated The Glob Rural Health Check caravan to the local regional Lions Clubs so they could carry on the free health check initiative, and set the template for other regions around New Zealand to follow.</p>
			<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[28px]">The mission and message is simple:</p>
			<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[28px]">To prove the need for rural community people, and farmers especially, to put a regular health check for themselves at the top of their list of farm maintenance priorities.</p>
			<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[28px]">The actual community health check screening activity with The Glob, including the enjoyable conversations it triggers and the hard data it provides, is simply a fun, visible and memorable tactic used to highlight that important message.</p>
			<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[28px]">It's been great to see The Lions Clubs out and about with The Glob at sale yards and farming community events. Around 20 - 25% of the farmers who had their checks had to be referred on to their GPs, highlighting how important it is for us all to get a regular health check.</p>
			<p class="text-[14pt] leading-[28px]">Awesome work Lion Clubs of New Zealand. Our team, Farmers Weekly NZ is proud to have backed this initiative.</p>
